This Python bot will scrap the informations of a pokemon Discord server.  
The bot then sends the informations to my own server.  
The Discord server that my bot scraps displays the best pokemons in __Pokemon Go__ found in the whole world.  
The goal of my bot is to select only the ones that interest me.  
I created a database with rules selecting the pokemons I wanted.  
I was able to change thoses rules from my discord server.
