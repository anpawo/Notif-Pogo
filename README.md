This Python bot will scrap the informations of a pokemon Discord server.
The bot then sends the informations to my own server.
The Discord server that my bot scraps displays the best pokemons in __Pokemon Go__ found in the whole world.
The goal of my bot is to select only the ones that interest me.
I created a database like of the pokemons I wanted and I was able to update my pokemon wishlist from my discord server.
